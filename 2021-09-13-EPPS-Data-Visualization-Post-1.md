Here are the notes from the video Journalism in the Age of Data as follows: 

Two research scientists Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Viegas from IBM Research have worked on a big visual communication data laboratory, called many eyes. 
This is a web site where many people could upload their own data, create interactive visualizations, and carry on conversations. Although Many Eyes was 
decommissioned by IBM in 2015, its ideas live on in many other visualization products.

DATA.GOV is the home of the U.S. Government's open data.

At the same time, journalism also include lots of data visualization in their coverages. Now, many media companies, such as the New York Times, BBC Online, etc. 
are hiring people who are skilled at data specialists, GIS software, etc. The journalists are exploring the ability of data visualization, communicating the 
context and the narrow element of the story. 

Many data visualization websites show you the data and let you make the conclusions, but without context, it still meaningless if there is the context in it. 
Story are also very important! 

There are also lots of bad visualization, which could make you get bad results. Thus, it's necessary to bring guideline to the users. Nowadays, there are so many statistical rich, data driven pieces. But it's hard to dig the deep meaning from these pieces.

The big companies, for instance, Google also has a project which aims at making data more accessible and more visible. 

As for the tools for data visualization, flare is one. Flare is an ActionScript library for creating visualizations that run in the Adobe Flash Player. From 
basic charts and graphs to complex interactive graphics, the toolkit supports data management, visual encoding, animation, and interaction techniques. 
Even better, flare features a modular design that lets developers create customized visualization techniques without having to reinvent the wheel.

Protovis (https://mbostock.github.io/protovis/), is another graphical approach to visualization. Protovis composes custom views of data with simple marks such as 
bars and dots. Unlike low-level graphics libraries that quickly become tedious for visualization, Protovis defines marks through dynamic properties that encode 
data, allowing inheritance, scales, and layouts to simplify construction.  Protovis is free and open-source, provided under the BSD License. It uses JavaScript 
and  SVG for web-native visualizations. Although programming experience is helpful, Protovis is mostly declarative and designed to be learned by example. 

Tool building is very important. The media companies, for example, the New York Times, NBC have their own templates in making visible charts and graphs. 

There are many easy tools that don't require a lot of technical skills to use, including swival, google charts, google API family, wordle, widgenie. There are 
also many active websites which analyze graphs and have interesting discussions about data visualization, for example, information aesthetics, flowing data, 
visual complexity, data blog. 

Academically, there is a conference, named IEEE Information Visualization Conference (IEEE InfoVis), where researchers publish papers and share their ideas of 
data visualization. 

The data visualization field is more competitive nowadays!
