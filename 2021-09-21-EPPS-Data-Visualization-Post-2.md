Here are the notes from the video -- Dr. Edward Tufteas' The Future of Data Analysis: 

Data analysis is about turning information into conclusions. Analytical thinking is about accessing and evaluating the relationship between information and conclusion. 
Tufte's work is about the relationship between evidence, inference and conclusions, making people smarter.
The purpose of data visualization, the purpose of data display is to assist reasoning about its content.
And so the principle of showing and thinking are derived directly from analytical thinking.
Analytical thinking is to explain something, to discover mechanisms, to define causes and effects. So the design principle is show causality, mechanism and explanation. To be practical , using annotative linking lines, not generic no nothing lines, use verbs, not nouns. Think trade-offs, think regression coefficients not correlations.
Show comparison and contrast differences and lots of them. The whole purpose of an analytical display is to assist the viewer's cognitive task in looking at evidence.

The future: the models in our future come from maps, real science and engineering, from high resolution technologies of display. 

We want intense design contain three dimension information, and we want them move. For example, the smart graceful typography done by Sirius Swiss typographers, the map of Swiss Alps.

The distribution of excellence is fiercely lognormal, skewed, long-tailed.

And here are some excellent thoughts from the videoes as shown in the pictures.

We should always ask ourselves that how do I know that, how does what I see come to be seen by me.

For what they show us is what we see. What we find is what we see. What we see is what we see.

And what we see may not contain the answer.
